# PRD-17: Scheduling System Frontend-Only Fix

## Current Status Block

**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-16  
**Implementation Date**: 2025-07-16  
**Type**: Frontend Sandbox Fix  
**Complexity**: Simple  

## Overview

This PRD focuses exclusively on fixing the broken scheduling system in the vet clinic sandbox application. This is a **frontend-only** implementation with no backend, database, or authentication requirements. All data is hardcoded and the app serves as a demonstration/prototype.

## Key Issues to Fix

1. **Config Access Errors**: Undefined config properties causing blank pages
2. **Browser Prompts**: Replace `prompt()` calls with proper modal dialogs
3. **Missing Error Boundaries**: Add error handling to prevent crashes
4. **Provider Lookup Failures**: Fix provider data access with hardcoded fallbacks

## Existing Files to Fix

### Core Scheduling Components
- `src/screens/SchedulingScreen.jsx` - Main scheduling interface (remove auth dependencies)
- `src/components/AppointmentScheduler/` - Scheduling UI components
- `src/services/SchedulingService.js` - Simplify to use hardcoded data
- `src/context/SchedulingContext.jsx` - State management (localStorage only)

### Supporting Files
- `src/config/pimsConfig.js` - Fix undefined access patterns
- `src/config/mockProviders.js` - Ensure fallback data always available

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Errors ✅ COMPLETED

**Implementation Notes:**
- All config access errors have been fixed with safe fallback patterns
- Error boundaries are implemented and working throughout the app
- Provider lookups use MOCK_PROVIDERS fallback when config is undefined
- No runtime errors occur when loading the scheduling screen

**What was implemented:**

**1.1 Fix Config Access Errors** ✅
```javascript
// Implemented in SchedulingScreen.jsx:39
const safeConfig = config || FALLBACK_CONFIG;

// Implemented throughout with safe provider access:
const providers = (providers && providers.length > 0 ? providers : MOCK_PROVIDERS);
```
- Added FALLBACK_CONFIG import
- Used optional chaining and null coalescing throughout
- All provider references use safe fallback pattern

**1.2 Add Error Boundaries** ✅
- `ErrorBoundary.jsx` already exists at src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx
- Integrated in main.jsx wrapping entire app
- Shows user-friendly error messages with refresh option
- Prevents app crashes from propagating

**1.3 Fix Provider Lookups** ✅
- MOCK_PROVIDERS defined in src/data/mockData.js
- All provider lookups use fallback pattern
- No database queries present (frontend-only)
- Mock data arrays used throughout

### Phase 2: Replace Browser Prompts ✅ COMPLETED

**2.1 Create Modal Components** ✅
- `CancelModal.jsx` - Created at src/components/Modals/CancelModal.jsx
- Reschedule functionality integrated into AppointmentForm with mode='reschedule'
- `ConfirmationModal.jsx` - Created at src/components/Modals/ConfirmationModal.jsx

**Implementation Details:**
- CancelModal includes reason selection dropdown
- ConfirmationModal supports Email/SMS/Both options
- All modals use proper React state management
- No window.prompt() or window.confirm() calls remain

**2.2 Update Interaction Patterns** ✅
- All browser prompts replaced with state-driven modals
- Modal state managed via useState hooks
- Form validation implemented in all components
- Toast notifications provide user feedback

### Phase 3: Simplify Data Layer ✅ COMPLETED

**3.1 Hardcode All Data** ✅

**Implemented in src/data/mockData.js:**
```javascript
// Mock appointment data
const MOCK_APPOINTMENTS = [
  {
    id: '1',
    patientName: 'Fluffy',
    ownerName: 'John Doe',
    date: '2025-07-17',
    time: '09:00',
    provider: 'Dr. Smith',
    type: 'Checkup',
    status: 'scheduled'
  },
  // ... more appointments
];

// Mock providers
const MOCK_PROVIDERS = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Dr. Smith', type: 'Veterinarian' },
  { id: '2', name: 'Dr. Johnson', type: 'Veterinarian' },
  { id: '3', name: 'Tech Sarah', type: 'Technician' }
];
```

**3.2 Use localStorage for Demo Persistence** ✅
- Appointments stored in localStorage via SchedulingContext
- No server/API calls present
- Clear data functionality via clearAppointments() method
- Data persists across page refreshes

### Phase 4: Ensure Core Workflows Work ✅ COMPLETED

**4.1 Test Slot Selection Workflow** ✅
- Click any available slot in calendar view
- AppointmentForm modal appears pre-filled with date/time
- Form includes patient search, provider selection, appointment type
- Save stores to localStorage and updates calendar immediately
- Toast notification confirms successful booking

**4.2 Test New Appointment Workflow** ✅
- "New Appointment" button in toolbar opens form
- Form includes all required fields with validation
- Patient search with autocomplete functionality
- Date/time picker with availability checking
- Successful save shows confirmation dialog option

**4.3 Test Find Available Workflow** ✅
- "Availability Grid" toggle shows provider/room availability
- Visual grid displays time slots with color coding
- Click available slots to book appointments
- Real-time updates when appointments are booked
- Multi-provider view shows all providers side-by-side

## Technical Approach

### Data Structure (Frontend Only)
```javascript
// All data stored in component state and localStorage
const SchedulingContext = {
  appointments: [], // Array of appointment objects
  providers: [],    // Array of provider objects
  selectedDate: new Date(),
  viewMode: 'day', // day, week, month
  
  // Methods
  addAppointment: (appointment) => {
    // Add to state
    // Save to localStorage
  },
  updateAppointment: (id, updates) => {
    // Update state
    // Save to localStorage
  },
  deleteAppointment: (id) => {
    // Remove from state
    // Update localStorage
  }
};
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
// Simple error boundary
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false, error: null };
  
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true, error };
  }
  
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return (
        <div className="error-fallback">
          <h2>Something went wrong</h2>
          <button onClick={() => window.location.reload()}>
            Refresh Page
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

### Modal Pattern
```javascript
// Replace prompt() with state-driven modals
const [showCancelModal, setShowCancelModal] = useState(false);
const [appointmentToCancel, setAppointmentToCancel] = useState(null);

const handleCancelClick = (appointment) => {
  setAppointmentToCancel(appointment);
  setShowCancelModal(true);
};

// In render
{showCancelModal && (
  <CancelModal
    appointment={appointmentToCancel}
    onConfirm={handleCancelConfirm}
    onCancel={() => setShowCancelModal(false)}
  />
)}
```
