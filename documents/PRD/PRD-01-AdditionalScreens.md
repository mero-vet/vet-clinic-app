# Product Requirements Document: Additional Screen Expansion

## Overview
This PRD outlines the plan to expand the existing Vet Clinic App simulator by adding five additional screens to the current five-screen system. This expansion will provide a more comprehensive training environment for our AI veterinary clinic assistant, allowing it to navigate and operate within a more complete simulation of a Practice Information Management System (PIMS).

## Current State
The application currently simulates five primary screens of a veterinary PIMS (Cornerstone):
1. Check-In/Out
2. Scheduler
3. Notes
4. Services
5. Invoices

## Goals
- Expand the simulation to include 5 additional screens (10 total)
- Maintain consistent UI/UX with existing screens
- Ensure all screens work with the existing data structure
- Create realistic workflows between screens
- Support AI agent training across common veterinary clinic tasks

## Proposed Additional Screens

### 1. Patient Medical Records
**Purpose:** Provide a comprehensive view of a patient's medical history.
**Key Features:**
- Timeline view of visit history
- Vaccination records and due dates

- Medical alerts and health warnings

### 2. Inventory Management
**Purpose:** Manage clinic inventory and supplies.
**Key Features:**
- Current stock levels

### 4. Pharmacy & Prescriptions
**Purpose:** Manage medication dispensing and prescription writing.
**Key Features:**
- Prescription writing interface
- Dosage calculator
- Drug interactions checker
- Prescription label generator
- Refill authorization workflow
- Controlled substance logging

### 5. Reports & Analytics
**Purpose:** Generate business and clinical reports.
**Key Features:**
- Revenue reports (daily, monthly, yearly)
- Provider productivity metrics
- Appointment statistics
- Inventory usage trends
- Client retention metrics
- Lab test frequency analysis

## Technical Implementation Plan

### User Interface Updates
1. Expand the icon bar to accommodate 10 icons
   - Maintain consistent visual style for new icons
   - Add appropriate tooltips for each new icon
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness with additional buttons

2. Update App.jsx to include new navigation paths
   ```jsx
   const iconData = [
     // Existing 5 icons
     // ...
     {
       label: 'Medical Records',
       iconUrl: '[url-to-icon]',
       hoverText: 'View patient medical records',
       path: '/records',
     },
     // Add remaining 4 new icons
   ];
   ```

3. Add new routes in the main routing component
   ```jsx
   <Routes>
     {/* Existing routes */}
     <Route path="/records" element={<MedicalRecordsScreen />} />
     {/* Add remaining routes */}
   </Routes>
   ```

### Data Structure Integration
The new screens will utilize the existing context providers:
- `PatientContext` - For patient medical data
- `SchedulingContext` - For appointment data
- `InvoiceContext` - For financial data

Additional contexts may be required:
- `InventoryContext` - For inventory and pharmacy data
- `CommunicationsContext` - For client communication data
- `ReportContext` - For aggregated analytics data

### Component Structure
Each new screen will follow the existing pattern:
1. Main screen component (e.g., `MedicalRecordsScreen.jsx`)
2. Supporting components in a dedicated folder (e.g., `/screens/MedicalRecords/`)
