# Product Requirements Document: AI Agent Testing & Logging System

## Overview
This PRD outlines the plan to implement a comprehensive testing and logging system for the veterinary AI assistant. This system will track, analyze, and report on the AI agent's performance as it interacts with the Vet Clinic App, providing valuable insights for improving the agent's capabilities and identifying areas of weakness.

## Current State
The Vet Clinic App functions as a sandbox for AI agent training but lacks structured testing capabilities and performance metrics. Without a formal testing framework, it's difficult to:
1. Measure the AI agent's success rate
2. Identify common failure points
3. Track improvements over time
4. Compare performance across different PIMS interfaces

## Goals
- Create a structured testing framework for AI agent interactions
- Implement detailed logging of agent actions and outcomes
- Develop metrics to measure agent performance
- Support test case creation and repeated execution
- Generate reports on agent efficiency and success rates
- Identify breakpoints and areas for improvement

## Proposed Solution

### System Architecture

#### 1. Test Management System
The core of the testing system will be a test management interface that allows:
- Creating and managing test scenarios
- Setting test parameters and expectations
- Executing tests with the AI agent
- Reviewing test results and metrics

#### 2. Logging Subsystem
A comprehensive logging system that captures:
- All agent actions and inputs
- System responses
- Time spent on each action
- Success/failure of specific tasks
- Screen transitions and navigation paths

#### 3. Analytics Dashboard
A reporting interface that provides:
- Success rate metrics
- Time-to-completion statistics
- Comparative analysis between test runs
- Breakpoint visualization
- Performance trends over time

### Detailed Requirements

#### Test Management

##### Test Case Definition Interface
```jsx
const TestCase = {
  id: 'test-123',
  name: 'New Client Registration',
  description: 'Test the agent's ability to register a new client and patient',
  startingScreen: 'checkin',
  startingPIMS: 'cornerstone',
  expectedActions: [
    { type: 'navigation', target: 'createNewClient', description: 'Navigate to new client form' },
    { type: 'input', field: 'clientFirstName', value: '[ANY]', description: 'Enter first name' },
    // Additional expected actions...
  ],
  successCriteria: [
    { type: 'data', field: 'clientId', condition: 'exists', description: 'Client ID is generated' },
    { type: 'navigation', destination: 'checkin', description: 'Returns to check-in screen' },
    // Additional success criteria...
  ],
  timeLimit: 120, // seconds
};
```

##### Test Execution Controller
- Start/stop/pause test execution
- Load predefined test cases
- Real-time monitoring of test progress
- Manual intervention capabilities
- Test recording for creating new test cases

##### Test Results Storage

#### Logging System

##### Action Logger
Captures all interactions between the agent and the application:
```javascript
{
  timestamp: '2024-03-19T13:45:22.123Z',
  agentId: 'agent-001',
  action: 'click',
  element: 'input[name="clientFirstName"]',
  value: 'John',
  screenName: 'createNewClient',
  pimsName: 'cornerstone',
  elapsedTime: 3.2, // seconds since last action
  testId: 'test-123',
  executionId: 'exec-456'
}
```

##### Error Logger
Records exceptions and deviations from expected behavior:
```javascript
{
  timestamp: '2024-03-19T13:46:05.789Z',
  agentId: 'agent-001',
  errorType: 'navigationFailure',
  description: 'Expected navigation to scheduling screen did not occur',
  context: {
    currentScreen: 'checkin',
    expectedScreen: 'scheduler',
    lastAction: { /* action details */ }
  },
  testId: 'test-123',
  executionId: 'exec-456'
}
```

##### Screen Transition Logger
Tracks navigation between application screens:
```javascript
{
  timestamp: '2024-03-19T13:45:31.456Z',
  agentId: 'agent-001',
  fromScreen: 'checkin',
  toScreen: 'createNewClient',
  transitionMethod: 'button-click',
  elapsedTime: 1.8, // seconds
  testId: 'test-123',
  executionId: 'exec-456'
}
```

##### Test Completion Logger
Records overall test results:
```javascript
{
  timestamp: '2024-03-19T13:48:12.789Z',
  agentId: 'agent-001',
  testId: 'test-123',
  executionId: 'exec-456',
  pimsName: 'cornerstone',
  result: 'success', // or 'failure', 'partial'
  completionTime: 170.5, // seconds
  actionsPerformed: 24,
  successCriteriaMet: 8,
  successCriteriaFailed: 0,
  breakpoints: [
    { 
      action: 15, 
      description: 'Delay in finding prescription field',
      timeSpent: 12.5 // seconds
    }
    // Other breakpoints...
  ]
}
```
