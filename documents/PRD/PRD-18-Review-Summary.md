# PRD-18 Review Summary

## Key Feedback and Concerns

### 1. **Scope Creep and Contradictions**
- The PRD claims "no new features" but proposes creating 10+ new files and a complete component library
- Complexity is marked as "Medium" but includes 6 phases with major architectural changes
- The scope seems more like a major refactor than "polish"

### 2. **Unclear Focus on Agent Testing**
- Mobile responsiveness (Phase 4) seems unrelated to computer use agent testing
- Animations and transitions (Phase 6) could make agent testing harder, not easier
- No concrete examples of current agent testing failures to address

### 3. **Technical Issues**
- Multiple code examples contain undefined functions: `validateSchema`, `preloadPIMSStyles`, `getCurrentState`, `applyOptimisticChange`
- Incomplete implementations (e.g., Tab key handler with TODO comment)
- No TypeScript despite mixed .tsx/.jsx files in the codebase

### 4. **Missing Critical Details**
- No time estimates or engineering effort assessment
- Vague file lists ("All form components", "All modals")
- No specific metrics for success criteria
- Missing rollback/feature flag strategy

### 5. **Priority Misalignment**
- Data corruption issues marked as "Low Priority"
- UI consistency marked as "Medium Priority" despite being crucial for agent testing
- Sequential 6-phase rollout could take months

## Critical Questions Needing Answers

1. **What specific agent testing failures are we trying to solve?**
2. **How many files will actually be modified?**
3. **What's the estimated engineering time for this work?**
4. **How do we handle the transition period with partial implementation?**
5. **Why create new components instead of fixing existing ones?**
6. **What's the rollback plan if changes break agent testing?**
7. **How will we ensure PIMS theme compatibility isn't broken?**
8. **What's the actual bundle size impact?**

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. **Split the PRD**
Create three focused PRDs:
- PRD-18A: Agent Testing Optimization (accessibility, IDs, ARIA)
- PRD-18B: UI Component Standardization
- PRD-18C: Performance and Polish

### 2. **Start with Agent Testing Focus**
- Document specific agent failures
- Implement only changes that directly improve agent reliability
- Defer mobile, animations, and non-essential polish

### 3. **Provide Complete Examples**
- Replace pseudocode with working implementations
- Define all referenced functions
- Include TypeScript types

### 4. **Create Specific Task Lists**
- List exact files to modify
- Provide time estimates per task
- Define measurable success criteria

### 5. **Add Technical Specifications**
- Naming conventions for IDs and test-ids
- PIMS theme integration approach
- Migration strategy for existing components

### 6. **Implement Safeguards**
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Automated testing to prevent regressions
- Rollback procedures

## Final Assessment

The PRD attempts to solve real problems but is too broad and lacks implementation clarity. It conflates "polish" with major architectural changes. For computer use agent testing optimization, a more focused approach targeting specific, documented failures would be more effective than this comprehensive overhaul.

The code examples need to be implementable, and the scope should be dramatically reduced to deliver value quickly while minimizing risk to the existing application.
