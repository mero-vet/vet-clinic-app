### Reconciliation Logic
```javascript
// End-of-day reconciliation process
async function performReconciliation(date) {
  const reconciliation = {
    date: date,
    financial: await reconcileFinancials(date),
    appointments: await reconcileAppointments(date),
    inventory: await reconcileInventory(date),
    discrepancies: []
  };
  
  // Check for discrepancies
  if (Math.abs(reconciliation.financial.cashVariance) > 5) {
    reconciliation.discrepancies.push({
      type: 'cash',
      amount: reconciliation.financial.cashVariance,
      severity: 'high'
    });
  }
  
  // Validate controlled substances
  reconciliation.inventory.controlledSubstances.forEach(item => {
    if (item.variance !== 0) {
      reconciliation.discrepancies.push({
        type: 'controlled-substance',
        item: item.drug,
        variance: item.variance,
        severity: 'critical'
      });
    }
  });
  
  return reconciliation;
}

// KPI calculation engine
function calculateKPI(definition, dateRange) {
  const data = fetchData(definition.dataSource, dateRange);
  const aggregated = aggregateData(data, definition.groupBy);
  
  return evaluateFormula(definition.calculation, aggregated);
}
```

### Report Generation
```javascript
// Dynamic report generation
async function generateReport(reportDefinition, parameters) {
  // Fetch data
  const rawData = await fetchReportData(
    reportDefinition.dataSource,
    reportDefinition.filters,
    parameters
  );
  
  // Apply transformations
  const processedData = processData(rawData, {
    groupBy: reportDefinition.groupBy,
    calculations: reportDefinition.calculations,
    sortBy: reportDefinition.sortBy
  });
  
  // Generate output
  const report = {
    metadata: {
      name: reportDefinition.name,
      generatedAt: new Date(),
      parameters: parameters
    },
    data: processedData,
    summary: calculateSummary(processedData),
    charts: generateCharts(processedData, reportDefinition.visualization)
  };
  
  return report;
}
```

## Success Criteria

- End-of-day closing completed in under 15 minutes
- Financial reconciliation accuracy of 99.9%
- Zero undetected controlled substance discrepancies
- Report generation time under 30 seconds
- 95% of routine reports fully automated
- Real-time KPI dashboard updates
- Customizable reports created in under 5 minutes

## Risks and Mitigations

### Financial Risks
- **Undetected discrepancies**: Multiple validation checkpoints and audit trails
- **Calculation errors**: Automated testing and validation rules
- **Missing transactions**: Real-time transaction logging and verification

### Operational Risks
- **Report delays**: Pre-calculated aggregations and caching
- **Data inconsistencies**: Data integrity checks and validation
- **User errors**: Guided workflows and confirmation steps

### Compliance Risks
- **Incomplete documentation**: Required field validation and compliance checks
- **Audit failures**: Comprehensive logging and tamper-proof records
- **Regulatory reporting**: Automated compliance report generation

## Future Considerations

- AI-powered anomaly detection
- Predictive analytics and forecasting
- Real-time financial dashboards
- Mobile reporting apps
- Voice-activated report requests
- Automated insights generation
- Benchmarking against industry data
- Integration with business intelligence tools
- Automated financial journal entries
- Machine learning for fraud detection
